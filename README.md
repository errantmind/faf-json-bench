# faf-json-bench

`faf-json-bench` is a Rust JSON serialization and deserialization benchmarking tool.

Only Linux is supported.

## Why

I was looking for benchmarks and couldn't find any that included all the libraries I wanted tested.

## Libraries Tested:

- [serde_json](https://github.com/serde-rs/json)
- [serde-json-core](https://github.com/rust-embedded-community/serde-json-core/)
- [nanoserde](https://github.com/not-fl3/nanoserde)
